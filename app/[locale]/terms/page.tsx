        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>These general terms and conditions are applicable to all legal relationships between CrossFit Leiden and the Client to which CrossFit Leiden has declared these general conditions applicable.</li>
          <li>These general terms and conditions are also applicable to all Agreements for the implementation of which third parties must be engaged.</li>
          <li>Any deviations to these general terms and conditions are only valid if they have explicitly been agreed upon between CrossFit Leiden and the Client in writing or in electronic form.</li>
          <li>The applicability of any purchasing conditions or other conditions of the Client is explicitly rejected.</li>
          <li>If one or more provisions in these general terms and conditions are invalid or is/are annulled, the remaining provisions of these general terms and conditions will remain fully applicable.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Article 3 – Offer</h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>CrossFit Leiden issues the offer for its Services directly to the Client in writing or in electronic form.</li>
          <li>The offer contains an accurate description of the Services offered. The description is sufficiently detailed to allow a proper assessment of the offer by the Client. Obvious mistakes or obvious errors in the offer are not binding on CrossFit Leiden.</li>
